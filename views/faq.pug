          Dreambounty is a platform for crowdfunding specific content that youâ€™d like to see content creators produce.
          Currently requests for creators from fans have no real place to develop and gain traction.
          Dreambounty makes it possible to support creators on a more gradular level, allowing you to fund only the content you really want to see.
          Anyone can create a request and anyone can contribute to it.
          An example request could be for your favourite YouTuber to make a video series on a topic you're interested in.
          If enough people agree with you and contribute to your request it'll be worth it for the creator to accept the request and produce that content.
